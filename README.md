# lwirth-lib

The *__lwirth-lib__* is a general purpose libary written entirely in C++ by *__Luis Wirth__*. It includes a game-/simulation-engine and uses the *__Vulkan-API__*.

## Purpose
The lwirth-lib is general purpose. It is made of the following seperate components: Math, Graphics, Physics, Memory managment and Artifical Intelligence. All of this combinds to form a game engine.


It also serves the purpose of practice, since it is the first game engine made by Luis Wirth.

## Components
### Graphics (Vulkan)

### Math

## How to get started/Setting up the project

The necessary dependencies for the *__lwirth-lib__* to run are the following:
* [Vulkan](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)
* [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/)



## Code example

```C++
#include "lwirth.hpp"

int main()
{
  lw::println("Code example coming soon");
}
```
